## List of URLs in OIRA's Inventory Report of information collections

The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget maintains [an XML file with an inventory of current information collections](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAXML).  Many of these information collections include an associated `<URL>` field and, in February 2024, we manually scrapped the websites in each of these.  

[The file is located here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/dataset/oira.csv).

## pulse.cio.gov Snapshot

Pulse.cio.gov, a predecessor project to the Site Scanning program, built a high quaility federal website index while it was in operation.  

The project was eventually deprecated in 2020, but a snapshot of its results provides a very good list of federal URLs that are still largely in use.  

The file is [located here](https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-websites/pulse-subdomains-snapshot-06-08-2020-https.csv) ([JSON](https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-websites/pulse-subdomains-snapshot-06-08-2020-https.json)) and can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/GSA/data/raw/master/dotgov-websites/pulse-subdomains-snapshot-06-08-2020-https.csv) ([JSON](https://github.com/GSA/data/raw/master/dotgov-websites/pulse-subdomains-snapshot-06-08-2020-https.json)).  

It contains roughly 24,600 urls.  

## Caveats

## Censys

Censys is a public search engine that scans the entire internet in order to generate useful data.  They offer open data researchers free access to the data in order to further public knownledge and analysis.  As part of that, the company provided a recurring export of every public hostname that they are aware of on port 80 or 440 that ends in .gov.   

The file contains approximately 250,000 URLs.

### Caveats

The initial file includes many state, local, and tribal websites as well, which are later pulled out.

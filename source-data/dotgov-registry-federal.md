## List of Federal .gov Domains

The official, full list of registered domains from the .gov top-level domain, filtered to those which are registered by federal agencies (as opposed to state, local, or tribal agencies). This includes .gov domains from the US Government's executive, legislative, and judicial branches.  

The file is [located here](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/blob/main/current-federal.csv) and can be [downloaded here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/main/current-federal.csv).  

It contains roughly 1,200 urls.  

### Caveats

* This dataset lists the domains that have been registered in the .gov registrar. This doesn't necessarily mean there's an internet-accessible website, email server, or other online service operated publicly on the domain.
* The file includes the small (<10) number of `fed.us` domains that exist as well.

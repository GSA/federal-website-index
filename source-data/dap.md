## Digital Analytics Program websites

The Digital Analytics Program (DAP) is a website analytics shared service that is available to all federal agencies. A daily export of the individual websites that have implemented DAP on at least one page is generated and hosted on analytics.usa.gov.  

[The file is located here]([https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/sites.csv](https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/sites-extended.csv)).   

It contains roughly 5,700 URLs.  

### Caveats 

* This dataset is generated by exporting the base websites (e.g. program.agency.gov) from the list of precise URLs (e.g. https://program.agency.gov/something/something-else) that participate in the DAP program.  Though unusual, it would be possible for that stripped down base website to be meaningfully different from the exact page that is hosting the DAP code and thus is present in the analytics system.  For instance, it's possible that the base website URL to not resolve (or to not have the DAP code on it).  In other words, just because this dataset has program.agency.gov in it, does not mean that https://program.agency.gov resolves or has implemented DAP.  Rather, it means that at least one URL that _begins_ with program.agency.gov resolves and has implemented DAP.

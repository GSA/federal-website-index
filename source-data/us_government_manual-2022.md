## US Government Manual

The Government Publishing Office maintains a U.S. Government Manual that includes a substantial amount of information about every federal agency.  By taking the [most recent XML version of the document](https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/GOVMAN) (the 2022 version) and pulling out the `<WebAddress>` field, we were able to isolate a number of federal websites into a new source dataset.  

[The file is located here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/dataset/gov_man-22.csv).

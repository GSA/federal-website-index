## US Courts List of Websites

The U.S. Courts website includes [a list of federal judiciary websites](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/federal-courts-public/court-website-links).  We manually scrapped the list of links on that page to generate a one-time snapshot of US Court websites in February, 2024.   

[The file is located here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/dataset/uscourts.csv).

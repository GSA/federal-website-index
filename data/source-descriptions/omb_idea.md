As part of OMB/Office of the Federal CIO's engagement with federal agencies in regards to implementing 21st Century IDEA, agencies were asked to identify which websites are part of their web presence and to note whether they are public-facing or not.  This data call, known at the time as Agency Action #2, resulted in a range of data that is distilled into this seed list.  The `Public-Facing` field is also used to populate the `public` field in the Site Scanning data set (Yes=TRUE,No=FALSE).  

The process by which the data is prepared to become a seed list involves: 
1. Save data to [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1GjNBTqG-DmzITN-bviqMvvQGCw-UZcGa)
2. Filter the All Responses sheet down to just the `URL Without WWW, HTTPS:// & Subdomain` and `Public-Facing (Final)` columns
4. Rename column headers to `Website` and `Public-Facing`
5. Sort by the `Website` column alphabetically (and ensure that no sites have a leading space)

There are about 9,600 websites in the file and it is located [here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/dataset/omb_idea.csv).

## End of Term 2016 Crawl

A volunteer group associated with archive.org attempts to crawl every federal website at the end of each presidential term.  Their efforts and the resulting data [can be found here](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/index.html).  The original datasets [can be found here](https://github.com/end-of-term/eot2016).  

A processed version of the dataset that we use for our website index [can be found here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GSA/data/master/end-of-term-archive-csv/eot-2016-seeds.csv).  

There are approximately 195,000 URLs in the dataset.

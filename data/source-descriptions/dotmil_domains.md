## List of .mil Domains

An unofficial list of registered domains from the .mil top-level domain. Unlike the .gov domain, there's not a publicly maintained dataset of registered .mil domains.  Therefor, this dataset is generated by extracting the list of .mil domains that are used by the various sources of .mil websites that the index uses.  

The file is [located here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/source-lists/dotmil_domains.csv) and can be [downloaded here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GSA/federal-website-index/refs/heads/main/data/source-lists/dotmil_domains.csv).  

It contains roughly 80 domains.

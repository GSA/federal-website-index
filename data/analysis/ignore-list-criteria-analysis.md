### tools.

There's currently 8 entries that begin with `tools.` in the federal website index.  
- 2 are public sites in their own right
- 2 are redirects
- 1 resolves to a blank page so should be removed
- 3 are for internal collaboration tools, so should be removed

Therefore, we should filter out the four specific sites we want to remove instead of filtering all tools. sites.

## Snapshots of website seed files

At the beginning of the [index creation process](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/process/index-creation.md), a copy of each [seed file](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/target_url_sources.csv) that is gathered is written to this folder to create a record of what each seed file contained before the index creation process began to combine, dedup, and process them.  

A description of each seed file can be found [here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/tree/main/data/source-descriptions).

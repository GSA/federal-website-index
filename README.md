# Federal Website Index

The goal of this project is to assemble an accurate, up-to-date list of the public websites of the federal government.  It turns out that there's a lot more to that than one might think, but this repository will get into the detail and nuance behind that and refer to the resulting datasets.  This effort is a part of the [Site Scanning program](https://digital.gov/site-scanning).    

## Background

Virtually every one of the ~800 agencies that make up the US federal government maintain one or more websites (e.g. `www.state.gov`, `space.commerce.gov`).  We know what .gov domains exist and which of them are registered by federal agencies because the .gov registry [makes this information public](https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv), but that only tells us what domains exist (e.g. state.gov, commerce.gov). Each domain may actually have hundreds of distinct websites (e.g. statecollection.census.gov and opportunity.census.gov are different websites than www.census.gov).  This project tries to find all of those distinct websites that are available to the public.
